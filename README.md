# road map

There are many things I would like to add in yolpo. Here are a few: 

* slow motion button - a button to execute the javascript in slow motion _almost done_
* option to display interim results
* concept of playlist - similar concept of a playlist for a video player 
* much better UI and UX - the UI and UX need to significantly improve. Currently editing is particularly unintuitive. 
* isomorphic API - currently yolpo's code is heavily dependent on some key dom components (e.g. IFrame for sandboxing the execution)
* github sign in integration

# collaboration 

Any feedback is welcome. Also, if you write a gist which runs on yolpo let me know and I would be happy to add it in the list above.
