<b>Introducing yolpo: a visual javascript runner for presenting and testing.</b>
<br><br>
<h2>Written for JS API authors</h2>
yolpo is a tool and a web site for javascript API authors.
The tool looks a bit like a video player but it runs javascript.
Use it to present your javascript code or to test your API or both.

<h2>A new interpreter</h2>
At its core, yolpo is a statement-by-statement javascript interpreter. This means that it does not 'eval' code in its entirety.
Instead, it starts by executing the first statement and continue by executing all statements in sequence.
This is the most natural way of presenting a program and a great fit for error discovery too.

<h2>GitHub integration</h2>

Use Gist GitHub to store code; then get yolpo to run it.
 

<!--


<h2>Get started in minutes</h2>
Just take a look at any example in explore; then try to write one yourself. Refer to the docs for further information.


<h2>A Static Web Application<h2>
yolpo is a web application delivered directly to an end user's browser without any server-side customization of the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript content. 
yolpo uses technologies in the browser instead of on the server to deliver dynamic content.

<h2>100% javascript</h2>
yolpo does not require you to learn a new language



what else ??? 

Combining the JSBin/JSFiddle/Codepen and mocha ...


<h2>Let it be run</h2>
There is the code for your JS API and then there is the code to exercise it.<xxBR>
Do not just put that code in a test folder or somewhere in your documentation. Share it with yolpo.

<h2>Forget eval and all of those witch hunters</h2>
EvalMyJS is  really a statement-by-statement javascript interpreter. It does not 'eval' the snippet in its entirety.<br>
A snippet is executed Programs start by executing the first statement and continue by executing all statements in sequence.
This is great for error handling too.
 -->
<!--
<h2>A statement-by-statement javascript interpreter</h2>
Forget eval and all of those witch hunters. At the heart of EvalMyJS is a statement-by-statement javascript interpreter.<xxBR>
It enforces a sequential-execution-model (the most natural way of thinking of a program)<xxBR>
Follow the flow with your finger.
 -->
<!--
<h2>100% javascript</h2>
There is really nothing new to learn.
Just try and think of your code as a sequence of plain and clear statements.
 -->

<!--
<h2>More than promises<!-- Asynchronous headaches solved </h2>
Use waitUntil and load. The only two functions that can access the PC (process counter) of the javascript interpreter.
See them in action here and here.
 -->

<!--
<h2>and more...</h2> 
<ul>
<li>Integration on gist GitHub</li>
<li>More than promises.</li>
<li>Perfect for regression tests (Fail Fast)</li>
</ul>
