<h2>The gist</h2>

We care about your privacy. Because we sit on the server side we inevitably have access to some information about you: your browser, date and time of your visit, 
your IP address, etcetera. If we bother to use this information, it is just in the aggregate to better understand how our visitors use our site. 
We don't sell it, rent it or disclose it to anyone. 
We 'd disclose it only if required by law or if we believe - in good faith - that disclosure is necessary to protect our web site and/or third parties.
We use google analytics. 
<p>
You don't have to register to use this website.
